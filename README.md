## Auto Gnome

Auto Gnome is an auto incrementing metronome and drone generator.

## What makes Auto Gnome special?

- Auto Gnome utilizes the Web Audio API for its ultra precise timing mechanism. For a detailed explanation of why you shouldn't just use SetInterval() to create a metronome, read [this](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/#toc-jsclock)

- Auto Gnome can auto increment itself! Simply set a goal tempo, an interval by which to increment itself, and the length of each interval, and voila! This is incredibly useful if you are practicing scales or trying to gradually push yourself to play something faster over a given period of time.
